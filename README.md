# Avatar Generator 🎨

This is a REACT standalone app that uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and the huggingface API to generate avatar images based on a character description.
It uses a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features 💡

- Asks users to provide a brief description of a character 🤔
- Uses the description to generate an avatar image using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model 🌟
- Displays the generated avatar in a user-friendly interface 💻

## Prerequisites 🧰

To use this app, you will need to have the following installed:

- REACT
- The huggingface API

## Installation & Getting Started 🛠
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Usage 🚀

To use the app, simply enter a brief description of the character that you would like to create an avatar for in the prompt and press the "Go" button. The app will then generate an avatar image based on the description.
